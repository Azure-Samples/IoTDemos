# Workplace Health and Safety Demo

[![Workplace Safety Demonstration](https://img.youtube.com/vi/wI3hP1gPYKw/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI3hP1gPYKw)

## Overview
The Workplace Health and Safety Demo provides the ability to identify unsafe work conditions using AI on Edge and Location Analytics IoT architecture patterns.

The AI on Edge pattern utilizes the Vision AI DevKit which utilizes the Azure IoT Edge Runtime with a custom IoT Edge python module that runs the Vision AI model and an Azure Stream Analytics (ASA) edge module.  The Vision AI model has been trained to identify a hard hat and a safety vests.  The ASA edge module logic sends only those events where a worker is identified not wearing a hard hat or a vest.  The ASA module aggregates / buffers the data so not every frame generates an alert.

The Location Analytics pattern is implemented through Azure Maps geofencing capability. An Azure Web App has been developed to behave like a client that submits GPS information to Azure Maps. The Azure Web App is used to create the geofence and register a client that submits coordinates of the device that is used to register (via the web app).  Controls on the Web App can be used to simulate the client moving in and out of the Geofence.

## Demo Script

</a>

### Deployment of resources

Follow the steps to deploy the required Azure resources:<br>
**BASICS**  

   - **Subscription**: Select the Subscription.
   - **Resource group**:  Click on 'Create new' and provide a unique name for the Resource Group
   - **Location**: Select the Region where to deploy the resources. Keep in mind that all resources will be deployed to this region so make sure it supports all of the required services. The template has been confirmed to work in West US 2.

**SETTINGS**    

   - **Prefix**: This value will be added to the resource names.
   - **Administrator Login**: Username account for the SQL Server (default: theadmin).
   - **Administrator Login Password**: Password for the administrator account of the SQL Server (default: M1cro$oft2020).
   - **Notifications Email**: Email where to send notifications from the logic apps.

1. Read and accept the `TERMS AND CONDITIONS` by checking the box.
1. Click the `Purchase` button and wait for the deployment to finish.
1. Review the output values:
      - Go to your `Resource group` and click `Deployments` from the left navigation.
      - Click `Microsoft.Template`
      - Click `Outputs` from the left navigation.
      - Save values for future use.

>IMPORTANT: You will need these values later in the setup.

#### Setup Visual Studio Code Development Environment
> Important: If the Visual Studio Code steps below don't work on your PC, consider using an Azure VM. The steps to setup the VM are outside the scope of this but are well documented [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/tutorial-manage-vm)
1. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) (VS Code).
1. Install 64 bit [Anaconda with Python version 3.7](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution).
1. Install the following extensions for VS Code:
    * [Azure Machine Learning](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.vscode-ai) ([Azure Account](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.azure-account) and the [Microsoft Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) will be automatically installed)

    > IMPORTANT: If you would llke to deploy your own model please refer to the `Custom Vision project setup` section in the `Optional Steps` section later in this document. You will need to increment the version number in tag property of `AIVisionDevKitGetStartedModule\module.json`if you wish to push another model after the initial one. 
1. **IMPORTANT**: Ensure you have `arm32v7` selected as the architecture in the bottom navigation bar of VS Code.

1. In the web browser, you will see your location has been updated. 
1. Create a geofence using the `Set Geofence` button. Create this fence outside of where your user is situated.
1. Use the `Adjust position` controls in the register view to move your user into the geofence. 
1. You will get a toast notification and email regarding the unauthorized entry.
1. You can move your user outside the geofence to receive notifications that the user has left.
    > NOTE: The user will expire after 10 minutes of inactivity. 


## Optional Steps

In this section we will describe some steps that are not required for the demo but allow for further customization if required. 

### SQL Server IP rule update

1. Click the new created project from the projects list.
1. Click the `Performance` option from the menu.
1. Click the `Iteration 1` if it's not selected (should be by default).
1. Click the `Export` button for the iteration.
1. Click the `Vision AI Dev Kit` icon button in the list.
1. Click the `Export` button.
1. Click the `Download` button.
1. Save the `.zip` file and extract the contents.
1. Copy and paste the contents of the file to `devkit\modules\AIVisionDevKitGetStartedModule\model`

> NOTE: If you have already deployed the provided model, you will need to increase the version value in `module.json` and create a new deployment to the device. These steps are outlined in the `AI DevKit Setup` section.


### Time Series Environment data load

In this section we will describe how to input some sample data into the Time Series Environment.

#### Run the application 
1. In Visual Studio click the `Play` button and wait for the console app to start.
2. The app will start the generation of the example data, a log with each message will be display in the console.
3. Wait until the process is finished.

# Troubleshooting
### Error when deploying ARM Template
We've seen issues with different subscription types: MSDN, AIRS, etc... not being able to deploy certain resources to certain regions.  We've found that deploying to East US works consistently.
