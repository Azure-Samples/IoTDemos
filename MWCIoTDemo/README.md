# Object Detection Demo
This demo provides an end-to-end architecture to enable object detection using IoT Edge, IoT Central, and PowerApps.

## Architecture


## Azure Resource Deployment

For a quicker setup, you can use an ARM file to deploy all the required resources in the solution.

### Create Resource Group

1. Setup your Azure subscription if you don't have one already. You can setup an account [HERE](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/).
1. Create a new **Resource Group** in the Azure Portal:

    * Login to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
    * Click the **Create a resource** button in the portal.
    * Enter the text `Resource group` in the search input field and select the displayed option.
    * Click the **Create** button in the new page.
    * Enter the required information:

        * Select the **Subscription**.
        * Enter the **Resource group** name.
        * Select the **Region** where to setup the Resource Group. _Keep in mind that all resources will be deployed to this region so make sure it supports all of the required services. The template has been confirmed to work in West US 2._

    * Click the **Review + Create** button at the bottom of the page.
    * Click **Create** to finish the creation of the Resource Group.

### Deployment of resources

Follow the steps to deploy the required Azure resources:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) select the **Resource Group** you created in the previous step.
1. Click the **+ Add** button or **Create resources**.
1. Enter the text **Template deployment** in the search input field and select the display option.
1. Click the **Create** button.
1. Click the **Build your own template in the editor** link.
1. Click the **Load file** button, search and select the `arm-template.json` file inside the `deployment` folder and click **Open**.
1. Click the **Save** button at the left-bottom corner.
1. Select the **Location** where to run the deployment.
1. Review and update if required all the **SETTINGS**:

    * `Prefix`: This value will be added to the resource names.
    * `Administrator Login`: Username account for the SQL Server (default: theadmin).
    * `Administrator Login Password`: Password for the administrator account of the SQL Server (default: M1cro$oft2020).

1. Read and accept the **TERMS AND CONDITIONS** by checking the box.
1. Click the **Purchase** button and wait for the deployment to finish.
1. Review the output values:

    * Go to your **Resource group** and click **Deployments** from the left navigation.
    * Click **Microsoft.Template**
    * Click **Outputs** from the left navigation.
    * Save values for future use.

    > IMPORTANT: You will need these values later in the setup.

    > NOTE: Connection to the SQL server is allowed from all IP Addresses by default. To update this rule, follow the instructions in the **Optional Steps** section.

## Post deploy configuration

Some resources require some extra configuration.

#### SQL Database schema

Here we will run the script for the creation of the tables required by the solution.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) select the **Resource Group** you created earlier.
1. Select the **SQL database** resource.
1. Click the **Query Editor** option in the menu.
1. Enter the username and password that you used as parameters during deployment and click the **Connect** button.
1. Copy the following script to the Query area:
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE alerts (
        IncidentId UNIQUEIDENTIFIER DEFAULT NEWID(),
        DeviceId NVARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
        IncidentType NVARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
        Status NVARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
        BlobUrl NVARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
        AlertNotified BIT DEFAULT 0,
        ReportedTime DATETIME NOT NULL,
        LastUpdated DATETIME
    )
    ```
1. Click the **Run** button.
1. You should be able to see the created table in the database.
1. Now replace the content of the Query area with the following code:

    ```sql
    CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[spFetchUpdateAlerts]
        @NewAlertsCount integer = NULL OUTPUT,
        @BlobUrl nvarchar(255) = NULL OUTPUT
    AS
    BEGIN
        SET NOCOUNT ON

        SET @NewAlertsCount =
        (
        SELECT COUNT(*)
        FROM dbo.alerts
        WHERE alerts.AlertNotified = 0 AND UPPER(alerts.Status) = 'UNRESOLVED'
        );

        IF (@NewAlertsCount = 0)
        BEGIN
        SET @BlobUrl = ''
        END
        ELSE
        BEGIN
        SET @BlobUrl = (
            SELECT BlobUrl
            FROM dbo.alerts
            WHERE alerts.AlertNotified = 0 AND UPPER(alerts.Status) = 'UNRESOLVED'
        );
        END

        DECLARE @MyTableVar table (
        [IncidentId] [uniqueidentifier] NULL,
        [DeviceId] [nvarchar](50) NOT NULL,
        [IncidentType] [nvarchar](50) NOT NULL,
        [Status] [nvarchar](50) NOT NULL,
        [BlobUrl] [nvarchar](255) NOT NULL,
        [AlertNotified] [bit] NULL,
        [ReportedTime] [datetime] NOT NULL,
        [LastUpdated] [datetime] NULL);

        UPDATE alerts
        SET alerts.AlertNotified = 1
        OUTPUT INSERTED.*
        INTO @MyTableVar
        WHERE alerts.AlertNotified = 0 AND UPPER(alerts.Status) = 'UNRESOLVED'
        SELECT *
        FROM @MyTableVar;
    END
    ```

1. Click the **Run** button.

### Container Registry Setup

1. Launch Visual Studio Code, and open the `$/device` folder.
1. Update the .env file with the values for your container registry.
    - In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) select the **Resource Group** you created earlier.
    - Select the **Container Registry** resource.
    - Select **Access Keys** from the left navigation.
    - Update the following in `device/.env` with the following values from the **Access Keys** within the Container Registry:

        CONTAINER_REGISTRY_ADDRESS=`<Login Server>` (Ensure this is the login server and NOT the Registry Name)

        CONTAINER_REGISTRY_USERNAME=`<Username>`

        CONTAINER_REGISTRY_PASSWORD=`<Password>`

    - Save the file.
1. Sign in to your Azure Container Registry by entering the following command in the **Visual Studio Code integrated terminal** (replace <CONTAINER_REGISTRY_ADDRESS>, <CONTAINER_REGISTRY_USERNAME>, and <CONTAINER_REGISTRY_PASSWORD> with your container registry values set in the .env file).

    `docker login -u <CONTAINER_REGISTRY_USERNAME> -p <CONTAINER_REGISTRY_PASSWORD> <CONTAINER_REGISTRY_ADDRESS>`

    > IMPORTANT: If you would llke to deploy your own model please refer to the **Custom Vision Project Setup** section in the **Optional Steps** section later in this document. You will need to increment the version number in the tag property of `device/modules/ImageClassifierService/module.json` if you wish to push another model after the initial one.

### Update Deployment Template

1. Open `device/deployment.test-amd64.template.json`.
1. Update the following desired properties for the **EdgeStreamJob** module with the value you got from Edge Stream Analytics Job earlier.
    ```json
    "ASAJobInfo": "<ASA Blob URL>"
    ```
1. Next we need to update the Camera Capture module desired properties. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), select the **Resource Group** you created earlier.
1. Select the **Storage Account** resource with the name ending with `storage`.
1. Go to **Access Keys** in the left pane.
1. Copy the **Storage account name** and **Key** value from the output.
    - Alternatively, you can generate a SAS for the container.
    - Click on **Storage Explorer (preview)** from the left pane.
    - Expand **BLOB CONTAINERS** and right-click on **forkliftimages** and select **Get Shared Access Signature**.
    - Ensure **Create** and **Write** are selected from the permissions.
    - Obtain the key.
    > NOTE: Either key will be fine for the next step. Creating a SAS key gives you more granular control over permissions to the container.

1. Update the following **desired properties** for the `CameraCapture` module.
    ```json
    "VideoPath": "rtsp://admin:@<camera_IP>//h264Preview_01_main",
    "StorageAccountName" : "<Storage account name from previous step>",
    "StorageAccountKey" : "<Key from previous step>"
    ```

    > NOTE: the video path with be specific to the camera in use. Check the manufacturer's documentation for more details.
1. Save the file.

### Deploy solution to the Container Registry

## Device Setup

### Azure VM

The easiest option to create a device is to use the IoT Edge template available in Azure.

1. **Provision** a new VM using the [template](https://portal.azure.com/#create/microsoft_iot_edge.iot_edge_vm_ubuntuubuntu_1604_edgeruntimeonly). Consider the following when provisioning:
    * You can use the existing resource group you have created or create a new one.
    * Ensure port 22 is open (this is the default).
    * Select a machine type with at least two vCPU cores.
    * If you haven't used SSH before/recently, password-based auth might be an easier option.
1. Once provisioning is complete, open your preferred shell.
    > NOTE: ensure you have SSH installed. If you're not sure, you can always use the [Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com).
1. Run `ssh <your-username>@<your-machine-ip-address>`.
    > NOTE: your username will be the one you specified during provisioning and your machine IP address will be available from the Azure Portal (by viewing the VM you just created).
1. Once connected to the machine, run `sudo nano /etc/iotedge/config.yaml`.
1. Comment out the following section (i.e. add `#` before each line):
    ```yaml
    provisioning:
        source: "manual"
        device_connection_string: "<ADD DEVICE CONNECTION STRING HERE>"
    ```
1. Uncomment out the following section (i.e. remove `#` before each line):
    ```yaml
    provisioning:
        source: "dps"
        global_endpoint: "https://global.azure-devices-provisioning.net"
        scope_id: "{scope_id}"
        attestation:
          method: "symmetric_key"
          registration_id: "{registration_id}"
          symmetric_key: "{symmetric_key}"
    ```
1. Update `{scope_id}`, `{registration_id}`, and `{symmetric_key}` with the values you copied from the previous section.
    > NOTE: `scope_id` refers to ID scope, `registration_id` refers to the device ID, and the `symmetric_key` refers to the primary key.
1. Press `CTRL + X`, `Y`, and the `Enter` to save and quit.
1. Run `sudo systemctl restart iotedge`.
